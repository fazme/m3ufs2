Abstract
========

This is a fuse-based filesystem that allows to work with m3u playlists as with
regular directories. It acts as a `mount --bind' command but replace all m3u
playlists located in a source directory with regular directories containing
all media listed in playlists.

Supported features are:
  - Extended m3u
  - Overlay mount, i.e. mounting directory and mountpoint can be the same
  - Process m3u playlists on demand (not during mount, but when you read them)
  - Track for m3u changes and apply them without remount
  - Shuffle

Playlist limitations:
  - All media with absolute path are ignored
  - Only regular files are supported right now
